# util-rs

An implementation of core UNIX utilities in Rust, compatible with the POSIX
standard where possible.

This project is academic rather than practical in nature, serving mainly as a
means to learn Rust, learn the standards, and learn how these core programs are
typically implemented.

I am using FreeBSD, currently `stable/12`, as an implementation reference.
